Window close trapping needs to be better:
  Apple menu Quit needs hooking up to it
  File menu Exit (Linux/Windows) needs hoking up to it - need builds on
  Linux/Windows with apple extensions (so it compiles), and needs testing.

File Menu items need correct mnemonics - see p175 of HIG
   
Is the PrefsLocation appropriate for Mac OS X? ~/.archivect is probably wrong.


Use a mock CursorManager in TestArchivectMainFrameFactory
