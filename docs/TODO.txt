Window close trapping needs to be better:
  Apple menu Quit needs hooking up to it
  File menu Exit (Linux/Windows) needs hoking up to it - need builds on
  Linux/Windows with apple extensions (so it compiles), and needs testing.

File Menu items need correct mnemonics - see p175 of HIG
   
Is the PrefsLocation appropriate for Mac OS X? ~/.archivect is probably wrong.


Use a mock CursorManager in TestArchivectMainFrameFactory

Add pixel-colour detections to the TestArchivectMainPanel tests.

Upgrade to jmock 2.6.0 when released, to hopefully fix thread safety issues in
TestLifecycleStartupAWTEventListener. Uncomment the expected calls to cursor
manager.normal - jmock 2.5.1 reports the missing expectation by terminating
the event thread, but the test does not fail.

Destination Editing:
  Is DestinationEditor.stopEditing being called to remove the listener?
  
  Destination editor should not allow the addition of a destination whose
  name already exists, nor should it allow the renaming of a destination to
  clash with an existing one.
  
  Test the DestinationEditor on Windows and Linux, and enable the small buttons
  there if they render correctly.
