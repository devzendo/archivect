Window close trapping needs to be better:
  Apple menu Quit needs hooking up to it
  File menu Exit (Linux/Windows) needs hoking up to it

MenuWiring: // TODO: smell: why can't you set a menu identifier's action listener before setting its menu item?
Should be able to set these at any time, and the relevant wiring of direct actionlistener to
menu item happens whenever the menu item is set.
