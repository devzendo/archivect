Window close trapping needs to be better:
  Apple menu Quit needs hooking up to it
  File menu Exit (Linux/Windows) needs hoking up to it

Apple menu needs correct name - should be solved by XPLP. 

Provide a better icon for ArchivectUI/src/main/resources/...icons/application.gif

CrossPlatformLauncherPlugin needs to be able to create a MacOSX command line application structure.
