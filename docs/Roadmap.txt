Archivect Roadmap
=================
Overall project goals:
* Cross-platform backup, verify, restore, archive. For Mac OS X, Ubuntu Linux,
  Windows XP and above.
* Stores backup files as sequential streams as per tar, but with individual
  file compression. Also creates an index tree allowing rapid access to the
  individual files in the stream.
* Creates incremental backups and allows these to be viewed as a point in time.
* Data can be restored from any point in time.
* Data can be presented as a full stream backup via tar. i.e. the on-disk
  format is dynamically reconstructed and presented as a tar pipe.
* Multiple backup jobs can be defined and scheduled either via cron or other
  system scheduler, or run under user control, either via GUI, command line, or
  invoked by taskbar control/menu.
